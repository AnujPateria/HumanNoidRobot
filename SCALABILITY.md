## 🚀 Handling More Users & Robots

- Backend services can **scale horizontally** by adding more instances
- **Load balancers** distribute requests to avoid overload
- **Stateless APIs** allow any server to handle any request
- One AI backend can support **multiple Kritrim robots**
- Each robot operates independently at the edge (Raspberry Pi)

---

## 🧠 Edge + Cloud Scaling

- **Edge (Robot-side):**
  - Handles real-time control and safety
  - Reduces latency and cloud dependency

- **Cloud (AI-side):**
  - Scales AI intelligence as interaction volume increases
  - Centralized updates improve all robots simultaneously

---

## 🛡️ Reliability & Fault Handling

- **Retry mechanisms** handle temporary failures
- **Failover servers** ensure high availability
- **Logging & monitoring** enable quick issue detection
- Modular hardware isolates faulty parts without stopping the robot

---

## 🔮 Future Scalability

- Transition to **microservices architecture**
- Cloud deployment on **AWS / GCP / Azure**
- Easy addition of new robot modules and AI features

---

## 🏁 Summary

Kritrim’s architecture supports:
- Growing user demand
- Multi-robot deployment
- Low downtime and easy maintenance
- Long-term scalability and adaptability
