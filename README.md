## 🧠 Project Overview

**Kritrim** is an AI-driven, modular humanoid robot designed with a **snap-and-fit architecture** that allows **tool-free replacement of robot parts by non-technical users**.

The system targets:

- MSMEs suffering from staff shortages and high maintenance costs  
- High-risk environments such as radiology rooms, chemical plants, and industrial zones where human exposure is dangerous  

Unlike existing humanoid robots that are expensive, monolithic, and hard to repair, **Kritrim is**:

- 70–80% cheaper  
- Fully modular  
- Repairable without engineers  
- Scalable across industries  

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Current humanoid robots face major limitations:

- Very high cost (₹20–60 lakh)  
- Non-modular hardware  
- Long downtime if a single part fails  
- Dependence on skilled technicians  
- Unsafe for hazardous environments  

These limitations make humanoid robots impractical for Indian MSMEs and public-facing or high-risk workplaces.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Kritrim introduces a **snap-and-fit modular humanoid architecture** where:

- Each body part (arm, head) is an independent module  
- Modules connect using **mechanical locking pins + standardized electrical connectors**  
- Faulty modules can be replaced instantly — **no tools, no engineers**  
- The robot automatically detects and configures new modules  
- Materials can be customized (radiation-safe, chemical-resistant, lightweight)

The **Raspberry Pi** is physically embedded inside the robot and acts as the on-device controller, while the **Gemini API** provides advanced AI intelligence.

---

## ⚙️ How the System Works (End-to-End)

1. User interacts with Kritrim using voice or physical presence  
2. Sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi capture audio/video input  
3. Raspberry Pi preprocesses input and sends it to the Gemini API  
4. Gemini API performs intent recognition, reasoning, and response planning  
5. AI-generated commands are returned to the Raspberry Pi  
6. Raspberry Pi maps commands to specific robot modules  
7. Robot executes actions (movement, speech, guidance)  
8. Sensors continuously provide feedback for adaptive behavior  
9. If a module is removed or replaced, the system auto-reconfigures
