# Kritrim – Snap-and-Fit Modular Humanoid Robot
Team: Ourobonics

## Problem
Humanoid robots today:
- Are extremely expensive
- Require engineers for repair
- Cannot be customized by end users
- Cause long downtime if one part fails

This makes them impractical for MSMEs, hospitals, and public service environments.

## Our Solution
Kritrim is a modular humanoid robot designed using a **pin + magnet snap-fit mechanism**.

Each robot part is a self-contained module.
If a module fails, **any normal person** can:
1. Remove the faulty module
2. Purchase a replacement module
3. Snap it into place — no tools, no engineers

The robot automatically detects the module and resumes operation.

## Key Innovation
- Tool-free snap-and-fit modular design
- Magnetic locking with alignment pins
- Human-centric multilingual interaction
- Designed for easy maintenance and scalability

## Use Cases
- MSME customer service desks
- Hospitals & radiology rooms
- Libraries and public help desks
- Industrial and chemical environments

## Prototype
Working prototype with AI interaction and modular concept demonstrated.
